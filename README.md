#  code2gist

`code2gist` is a Python package that makes sharing your code projects easier than ever. With a simple command, it lets you upload your code files to GitHub's Gist. `code2gist` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/code2gist/).

The package works hand-in-hand with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4's 'Browse with Bing' feature. This compatibility allows you to present substantial code bases to the model in a single instance, eliminating the need to split your code into smaller parts.

Another key feature of `code2gist` is its ability to handle a wide range of text-based file types, not just Python files.

In addition, `code2gist` comes with a `prune` feature that provides a clean way to remove all the gists created by this tool from your GitHub account.

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```
bashCopy code
pip install code2gist
```

## Usage

### Uploading Files

To use `code2gist`, simply use the following command:

```
bashCopy code
code2gist .
```

This command will upload all Python files in the current directory to a private Gist on your GitHub account. The Gist will be titled with the name of the current directory, followed by "[code2gist]".

If you want to include files with different extensions, you can specify them using the `--ext` option:

```
bashCopy code
code2gist . --ext .txt .md .py
```

This command will include all text, Markdown, and Python files in the upload.

### Deleting Gists

The `prune` feature allows you to delete all gists created by `code2gist`:

```
bashCopy code
code2gist --prune
```

Running this command will delete all your gists with "[code2gist]" in the description.

## GitHub Token

`code2gist` requires a GitHub token to function. You need to create a new token with the `gist` scope (which allows it to create gists). Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to create a new token.

Once you have your token, you should store it in the "GITHUB_TOKEN" environment variable. Here are the steps to set this variable in Windows:

1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Search for "Environment Variables".
3. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
4. In the System Properties window that appears, click the "Environment Variables..." button.
5. In the Environment Variables window, click the "New..." button under the "User variables" section.
6. Enter "GITHUB_TOKEN" as the variable name and your token as the variable value.
7. Click "OK" on all open windows to apply the changes.

Please ensure that you have this variable set before using the package.

## .gitignore Support

`code2gist` respects `.gitignore` rules. Files that match a rule in the `.gitignore` file of the directory being uploaded will be skipped. In addition, by default, `code2gist` skips files and directories that start with a dot (`.`), although this behavior may change in future versions to strictly adhere to `.gitignore`.

## Note

The gists created by `code2gist` are private by default, providing a safe way for you to share your code without making it publicly available.

Please remember that `code2gist` is a tool for sharing code and should not be used to share sensitive information. Always ensure that your files do not contain any confidential data before uploading them.
